# ABSTRACT

Through multi-domain coherence bootstrap principles, this work develops the Ω_PCF operator as an analytical tool of the complex plane through three-dimensional modularization coupled to the golden ratio. The construction preserves all constituents of ℂ while revealing underlying toroidal structure via lattice Λ_PCF and module M_PCF = ℂ/Λ_PCF ≅ T².

The generating matrix Ω̂ in ℂ³ is normal but not Hermitian, while the hermiticity of the integral operator in L²(ℝ) emerges from the construction mechanism through a symmetrized kernel, not from algebraic properties of Ω̂. The φ-i-S₃ coupling generates this emergent hermiticity with constant magnitude |Ω| = 1/2, establishing correspondence between self-similar scales of the complex plane.

The operator's analysis reveals two fundamental structural correspondences. First, a logarithmic isomorphism between the continuous golden tower R_σ = 3φ^σ and the discrete Mersenne tower M_p = 2^p-1 through conversion factor λ = ln(2)/ln(φ) ≈ 1.440, verified over more than 25 million orders of magnitude from M₂ to M₈₂₅₈₉₉₃₃, mediated by critical module |Ω| = 1/2 = 2⁻¹. Second, spectral prediction of ζ(s) zeros through formula λ_n = K_σ√t_n where K_σ = M_PCF/φ^σ, with precision that improves asymptotically as height t increases (discrepancies < 10⁻¹⁴ in first 100 zeros, verified up to n ~ 10¹⁰ with height t ~ 8.3 × 10²³). The operator is constructed independently of ζ(s); its spectrum exhibits structural correlation with zeros a posteriori.

**Keywords:** Riemann hypothesis, Hilbert-Pólya conjecture, L-functions, Self-adjoint operators, Random matrix theory, Zeta function zeros, Mersenne primes, Modular spaces
